DESCRIPTION OF METADATA COLUMNS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CFM5.3_Metadata.xlxs file contains the CFM5.3 metadata. 
Here, we provide some information about the columns in the spreadsheet.

CFM5.3 Fault Object Name
   This is the CFM object name. All object names use a heirarchical naming scheme and are consistently formatted to
   facilitate users that plan to write scripts to automate CFM tasks. All object names have 5 parts separated by dashes.
   For example:

     1    2    3         4           5
   SAFS-SAFZ-PARK-San_Andreas_fault-CFM4

      1 - Fault Area/Major Fault System
      2 - Fault Zone/Region
      3 - Fault Section
      4 - Fault Name
      5 - CFM Version of Last Update
   
Source/Author
   The group or person that created the surface.
   
Last Update
   The CFM version when the surface was last significantly modified.
   
Avg Strike, Avg Dip
   The avg strike and dip is determined (in the native mesh) by calculating each triangle's unit normal vector, and 
   then weighting by surface area. The total weighted normal vector is then used to calculate the strike and dip. 
   Strike is generally reported using the right hand rule, but occasionally along nearly vertical faults, the strike
   direction can flip by 180 degrees due to variations in dip. In these cases, we correct for these 180 degree 
   changes in strike, so the strike direction is consistent.
   
Area [km^2]
   The total surface area of the native mesh fault object in km^2.
   
Exposure
   This states whether a fault is "blind" or "surface" breaching. Only faults that are completely blind are reported as blind.
   
Slip Sense
   The slip sense is based on published literature where possible, but when no clear data is available, we base the 
   expected sense of slip based on the orientation of the fault surface. In general we label E-W trending faults as 
   reverse slip, NE/SW faults as left-lateral and NW/SE faults as right-lateral. So, the slip sense category is only 
   meant as a very general approximation of what is likely more complex in reality.
   
   Slip Sense Examples:
      rlss - right-lateral strike-slip
	  llss - left-lateral strike-slip
	     n - normal
		 r - reverse/thrust
	  orlr - oblique right-lateral reverse
	  ollr - oblique left-lateral reverse
      orln - oblique right-lateral normal
	  olln - oblique left-lateral normal

ID Comments
   Notes about when the CFM team has put in a USGS request for a new QFault ID.

USGS ID
   The USGS QFaults ID.
   
Fault Strand/Model Description
   Any additional information, if needed, about the fault object.

References					
   References include only primary sources that help define fault traces and/or subsurface geometries, as well as 
   subsequent studies that have built upon and modified these representations. In many cases, initial 3D fault 
   representations were generated by the CFM development team. In these cases, we generally list the primary sources 
   for data used for subsurface control, and SCEC abstracts that presented these new 3D representations. This 
   reference list should not be considered as a comprehensive set of references describing other aspects of southern
   California fault systems. If you notice missing or incomplete references, please forward these or other inquiries
   to the CFM developers by emailing scec-cfm-l@usc.edu.

METADATA COLUMNS THAT ARE NO LONGER UPDATED/USED
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Descriptor
   A 4 character code that describes the object. No longer updated.

Num
   The various "Num" columns are meant to give each object a unique number, but note that these are no longer used
   and are included only for historical purposes.
   
Alternative
   This indicates which version of a fault is in the preferred model. No longer updated.
