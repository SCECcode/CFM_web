CRM_polygons_points_with_corrected_Rift_names_Mar112019.csv was created by Andreas Plesch
(Harvard) March 11, 2019 to break identically-named Accretionary Complex and Rift Margin 
domains into Accretionary Complex 1 and 2, and Rift Margin 1, 2 and 3 because problems arose 
with some codes displaying these regions when their names were identical.

CRM_polygons.lonlat was generated for Matlab query code by Elizabeth Hearn on March 11, 2019. 
It is consistent with the March 11, 2019 csv file.
