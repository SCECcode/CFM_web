Version 6.0 of the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Community Fault Model (CFM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION OF METADATA COLUMNS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CFM6.0_Metadata.xlxs file contains the CFM6.0 metadata. New to CFM6.0 are a rupture model that provides
faults that ruptured during significant historic events, and an alternative model that provides alternative
representations of faults where geometric differences have been proposed that may significantly change fault 
mechanics and seismic hazards. See the README.txt file in the root directory of the archive for more information 
on these models.

Here, we provide descriptions of the columns in the metadata spreadsheet. These same columns are used in the 
preferred, ruptures, and alternative model sheets.

CFM6.0 Fault Object Name
   This is the CFM object name. All object names use a hierarchical naming scheme and are consistently formatted to
   facilitate users that write scripts to automate CFM tasks. All object names have 5 parts separated by dashes.
   For example:

     1    2    3         4           5
   SAFS-SAFZ-PARK-San_Andreas_fault-CFM4

      1 - Fault Area/Major Fault System
      2 - Fault Zone/Region
      3 - Fault Section
      4 - Fault Name
      5 - CFM Version of Last Update. For ruptures and alternatives, the object name will end in RUP6 or ALT6 to
	      Indicate when these versions became rupture or alternative model objects or were updated.
   
Source/Author
   The group or person that created the surface.
   
Last Update
   The CFM version when the surface was last significantly modified or changed to be preferred/alternative
   
Avg Strike, Avg Dip
   The avg strike and dip is determined (in the native mesh) by calculating each triangle's unit normal vector, and 
   then weighting by surface area of the triangle. The total weighted normal vector is then used to calculate the 
   strike and dip. Strike is generally reported using the right hand rule, but occasionally along nearly vertical 
   faults, the strike direction can flip by 180 degrees due to small variations in dip. In these cases, we correct
   for these 180 degree changes in strike, so the strike direction is consistent along the fault.
   
Area [km^2]
   The total surface area of the native mesh fault object in km^2.
   
Exposure
   The column states whether a fault is "blind" or "surface" breaching. Only faults that are completely blind are 
   reported as blind.
   
Slip Sense
   The slip sense is based on published literature where possible, but when no clear data is available, we base the 
   expected sense of slip based on the orientation of the fault surface. In general we label E-W trending faults as 
   reverse slip, NE/SW trending faults as left-lateral and NW/SE trending faults as right-lateral. Therefore, the 
   slip sense category is only meant as a very general approximation of what is likely more complex in reality.
   
   Slip Sense Examples:
      rlss - right-lateral strike-slip
	  llss - left-lateral strike-slip
	     n - normal
		 r - reverse/thrust
	  orlr - oblique right-lateral reverse
	  ollr - oblique left-lateral reverse
      orln - oblique right-lateral normal
	  olln - oblique left-lateral normal

ID Comments
   Notes about when the CFM team has put in a USGS request for a new QFault ID.

USGS ID
   The USGS QFaults ID.
   
Fault Strand/Model Description
   Any additional information, if needed, about the fault object.

References					
   References include only primary sources that help define fault traces and/or subsurface geometries, as well as 
   subsequent studies that have built upon and modified these representations. In many cases, initial 3D fault 
   representations were generated by the CFM development team. In these cases, we generally list the primary sources 
   for data used for subsurface control, and SCEC abstracts that presented these new 3D representations. This 
   reference list should not be considered as a comprehensive set of references describing other aspects of southern
   California fault systems. If you notice missing or incomplete references, please forward these or other inquiries
   to the CFM developers by emailing scec-cfm-l@usc.edu.

METADATA COLUMNS THAT ARE NO LONGER UPDATED/USED
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Descriptor
   A 4 character code that describes the object. No longer updated.

Num
   The various "Num" columns are meant to give each object a unique number, but note that these are no longer used
   and are included only for historical purposes.
   
Alternative
   This indicates which version of a fault is in the preferred model. No longer updated. Alternative representations
   are provided now separately.
