## CFM data service

Software stack at the backend server node when postgres and postgis are
being built from source:

- git
- gcc
- readline-develp
- zlib-devel
- json-c
- autoconf
- libxml2-devel
- libtool
- postgres version a10.5
 - proj5
 - gdal
- postgis version 2.5.1
- apache web server


Data preprocessing instructions are in doc/how-to-preprocess-data, xlsx file is in 
schema/CFM5_release_2021 and the scripts are in schema/scripts 


### Deployment

Deployment is accomplished using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) with [docker-compose]([https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Clone the git repository and run the commands below for development or production deployment.

#### Development Deployment
1. Run: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f development.yml up -d`
2. After the build is complete, browse to http://localhost:8081
3. The development.yml maps the code directory to the container for easy code development and exposes port 5432 for directly accessing the Postgres database.

#### Production Deployment
1. Run: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`
2. After build is complete, browse to http://server-name:8081
3. Optionally, set up a reverse proxy from a URL on an existing web server to localhost:8081.
