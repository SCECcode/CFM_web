Files in schema/data are being used by the sql scripts in schema/sql to populate the
CFM data server's postgres database

When the Faults Model xlsx file (schema/CFM5_release_2017/CFM5.2-Fault_ID_preferred.xlsx)
get updated, several csv files in schema/data need to be regenerated.  Scripts are in 
schema/scripts.

    extract-csv.sh  -- convert xlsx to various target.csv files
                       check zone_tb.csv, section_tb.csv, area_tb.csv and fault_tb.csv to
                             see if there are similar/duplicate entries
                       move target.csv to data directory
    covert-shp.sh   -- convert blind/non-blind shp file to target.sql
                       move target.sql to sql directory

    create various object_target_tb.csv from the original ts directory to final amazonaws
    storage location using awk/sed and move the data directory


When the T-surf files get updated, or moved (schema/data/object_1000m_tb.csv, 
schema/data/object_500m_tb.csv, schema/data/object_native_tb.csv), depending on 
the changes, they might need to be adjusted. There is no script for doing this
currently. The initial set came from https://github.com/SCECcode/CFM
