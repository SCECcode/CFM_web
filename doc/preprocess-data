When there is an update to Faults Model xlsx file, CFM5.2-Fault_ID_preferred.xlsx,
several csv files in schema/data need to be regenerated. Scripts are in schema/scripts.

When the T-surf files get updated, or moved, depending on the changes,
schema/data/object_1000m_tb.csv, schema/data/object_500m_tb.csv,
schema/data/object_native_tb.csv might need to be tweaked. The initial set came
from https://github.com/SCECcode/CFM
